# About Us

We make robots for the [MATE ROV](https://materovcompetition.org/) competition as students from varied backgrounds with a shared passion for innovation and a bright future. Together, we bring different skills, creative ideas, and perspectives to the table, helping us address the world's challenges with innovative solutions. We are unafraid to think big, take bold risks, and learn from our mistakes. As the change-makers of tomorrow, we are committed to shaping a better world.
